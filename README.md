# SummerPractice
All data are stored in an excel table in xlsm format. This table also includes calculation modules that convert raw data into useful information using macro's embedded in the table. The table consists of seven sheets, the last three of which are initially empty and are filled after the activation of user-defined macros with certain parameters. 
This project solves a problem of creating an algorithm that automates macros activation and subsequent parsing of the last three pages into csv format.
